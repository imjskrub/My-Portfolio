                                    <p>In Junior years, I was kid wondering and wandering what it's like to be in High School. I heard a lot in the movies,
                                        in social media, and even from my seniors that being in High School would be fun and you can grow and learn to enjoy things in life.
                                        It was indeed a lot of fun. In my 7th, 8th, 9th-Grade, I wasn't really aiming to be on top, to excell in my academics because 
                                        all I wanted to do is just enjoy my times in high school but later in my 10th-Grade I started to earn my credentials so i could bring
                                        something when I graduate in my High School. <br>

                            <h3>College Year</h3>
                            <p>I am currently in my fourth year of college, and my journey has been defined by growth through adversity. My freshman and sophomore years were especially challenging, as I faced realities I never expected so early in life. Becoming a working student was not part of my original plan, but due to financial limitations, my mother who singlehandedly supports our family has encouraged me to work within our institution so I could continue my education. Balancing academics and work was difficult, and it took time for me to fully accept this reality. However, I chose to persevere. I am a dreamer who embraces risks and never lets opportunities pass by. While I was once an academic achiever, I learned that grades alone do not define my worth or potential. Instead, I focused on personal growth, skill development, and making meaningful contributions. Through this journey, I discovered my passion for leadership. As a student leader, I realized that success can be achieved through many paths, and mine is rooted in self-awareness, resilience, and service. I strive to make an impact, influence others positively, and continue developing myself—not just as a student, but as a person.
